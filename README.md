## Overview

The Multimodal RAG System is a production-ready artificial intelligence platform designed to ingest, process, and intelligently query diverse data formats through a unified semantic retrieval framework. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models and vector databases, the system operates entirely offline while maintaining enterprise-level performance and accuracy.

### Problem Statement

Modern organizations face challenges in extracting meaningful insights from heterogeneous data sources. This system addresses the critical need for a unified intelligence platform that can process documents, images, and audio files while providing accurate, contextual responses through advanced language models—all without requiring internet connectivity.

## Usage

### Document Upload

The system accepts multiple file formats simultaneously. Navigate to the upload interface, select your files, and the system will automatically process and index the content using appropriate extraction methods for each format.

### Querying Your Knowledge Base

**Text Queries**
Submit natural language questions directly through the interface. The system will analyze your query, retrieve relevant information, and generate a comprehensive response with cited sources.

Example: *"What are the key implementation details for the authentication module?"*

**Image Queries**
Upload images containing text or visual information. The OCR engine extracts text content, and the system searches for related materials across your entire knowledge base.

**Audio Queries**
Submit audio recordings in any supported format. The system transcribes the audio and processes the resulting text to find relevant information.

### Understanding Results

Results are presented in a structured format:

- **Generated Answer**: Comprehensive response with summary, key points, actionable steps, insights, and conclusions
- **Source Citations**: Numbered references with relevance scores indicating confidence levels
- **Source Access**: Direct links to view original documents with highlighted relevant sections

# Verify port availability
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Change port in .env file if needed
PORT=8001
```

**GPU Not Detected**
```bash
# Verify CUDA installation
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi
```

**Slow Performance**
- Ensure GPU drivers are up to date
- Use GPU-optimized startup script
- Verify CUDA is properly configured
- Check available system memory

**Model Download Issues**
```bash
# Manually verify Ollama installation
ollama list

# Re-pull model if needed
ollama pull phi3
```
